## 🎯 Major Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Vendor Matching on CSV Import

**What it does:**
- Reads supplier names from CSV "Supplier" column
- Uses fuzzy matching (70% confidence threshold)
- Matches variations: "Amazon" → "Amazon Business" ✅
- Auto-creates new vendors if no match found
- Links equipment to `supplier_id` in database

**Console Output:**
```
[Vendor Matching] Processing 3 unique vendors from CSV...
[Vendor Matching] ✓ Matched "Amazon" to "Amazon Business" (95% confidence)
[Vendor Matching] ✓ Matched "Crestron" to "Crestron Electronics" (88% confidence)
[Vendor Matching] ➕ Creating new vendor: "New Vendor Inc"
[Vendor Matching] ✓ Created vendor "New Vendor Inc" with short code: NVI
[Vendor Matching] Complete: Processed 3/3 vendors
[Vendor Linking] Linking 45 equipment items to vendors...
[Vendor Linking] ✓ Linked 45 items to vendors
```

### 2. Wire Drop Preservation During REPLACE Mode

**What it does:**
- Saves wire drop links before deleting old equipment
- Matches old equipment to new equipment by:
  - part_number + room_id + install_side + name
- Restores wire drop links with new equipment IDs
- Logs success/failure for each link

**Console Output:**
```
[Wire Drop Preservation] Found 45 equipment items to replace
[Wire Drop Preservation] Found 12 wire drop links to preserve
[Wire Drop Restoration] Attempting to restore 12 wire drop links...
[Wire Drop Restoration] ✓ Successfully restored 12 wire drop links
[Wire Drop Restoration] Summary: { restored: 12, failed: 0, failures: [] }
```

### 3. Vendor View with Fuzzy Matching

**What it does:**
- Groups equipment by supplier in Order Equipment page
- Shows match confidence badges
- Displays vendor stats (Total, Matched, Needs Review, New)
- Expandable vendor cards with equipment details

**UI Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Total Vendors: 3                    │
│ Matched: 2                          │
│ Needs Review: 0                     │
│ New Vendors: 1                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Amazon Business  ✅ 95% Match      │
│ 15 items • $1,234.56                │
│ [Generate PO]                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Crestron Electronics  ✅ 88% Match │
│ 8 items • $5,678.90                 │
│ [Generate PO]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📋 Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations ⚠️ REQUIRED

Run these SQL files in Supabase (in order):

#### ✅ Migration 1: Procurement Tables
**File:** `supabase/procurement_system_fixed.sql`
- Creates suppliers, purchase_orders, PO items, tracking tables
- Seeds 5 sample suppliers
- Creates auto-numbering function

#### ✅ Migration 2: Add supplier_id to Equipment
**File:** `supabase/add_supplier_id_to_equipment.sql`
- Adds `supplier_id` column to `project_equipment`
- Creates index for fast lookups

### Step 2: Import Equipment CSV

1. Go to Project → Inventory Management
2. Choose import mode:
   - **REPLACE**: Full replacement (wire drops preserved automatically!)
   - **MERGE**: Add/update items (keeps everything)
3. Select CSV file and import
4. Watch console for vendor matching logs

### Step 3: Test Vendor View

1. Go to Order Equipment
2. Select "Prewire Prep" or "Trim Prep" tab
3. Click "Vendor View" toggle
4. Verify equipment grouped by vendor
5. Check match badges (green = matched, blue = new)

---

## 📊 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Import (No Wire Drops Yet)

**Steps:**
1. Apply migrations
2. Import CSV (REPLACE mode)
3. Check console for vendor matching
4. Go to Order Equipment → Vendor View
5. Verify vendors appear grouped

**Expected:**
- ✅ Vendors matched/created
- ✅ Equipment linked to suppliers
- ✅ Vendor View shows grouped equipment

### Scenario 2: Import with Wire Drops Linked

**Steps:**
1. Project has equipment with wire drops linked
2. Update CSV (change quantities, add items)
3. Import CSV (REPLACE mode)
4. Check console for wire drop restoration

**Expected:**
- ✅ Old equipment deleted
- ✅ New equipment inserted
- ✅ Wire drops automatically restored
- ✅ Console: "restored: X, failed: 0"

### Scenario 3: Import with Equipment Removed

**Steps:**
1. Project has equipment with wire drops
2. Edit CSV - remove 2 items
3. Import CSV (REPLACE mode)
4. Check console for restoration summary

**Expected:**
- ✅ Most wire drops restored
- ⚠️ 2 wire drops failed (equipment removed)
- ⚠️ Console warnings for failed links

### Scenario 4: Vendor Name Variations

**Steps:**
1. CSV has: "Amazon", "Crestron", "C4"
2. Database has: "Amazon Business", "Crestron Electronics", "Control4"
3. Import CSV
4. Check console for matching

**Expected:**
- ✅ "Amazon" → "Amazon Business" (matched)
- ✅ "Crestron" → "Crestron Electronics" (matched)
- ✅ "C4" → "Control4" (matched)
- ✅ Equipment linked to correct suppliers

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch

### During CSV Import:

1. **Vendor Matching:**
   - `[Vendor Matching] Processing X unique vendors...`
   - `[Vendor Matching] ✓ Matched "..." to "..." (X% confidence)`
   - `[Vendor Matching] ➕ Creating new vendor: "..."`

2. **Vendor Linking:**
   - `[Vendor Linking] Linking X equipment items...`
   - `[Vendor Linking] ✓ Linked X items to vendors`

3. **Wire Drop Preservation (REPLACE mode):**
   - `[Wire Drop Preservation] Found X equipment items to replace`
   - `[Wire Drop Preservation] Found X wire drop links to preserve`

4. **Wire Drop Restoration:**
   - `[Wire Drop Restoration] Attempting to restore X links...`
   - `[Wire Drop Restoration] ✓ Successfully restored X links`
   - `[Wire Drop Restoration] Summary: {...}`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to group equipment by vendor"

**Cause:** Database migrations not applied

**Fix:**
1. Apply `procurement_system_fixed.sql`
2. Apply `add_supplier_id_to_equipment.sql`
3. Re-import CSV

### Issue: All vendors show "Unassigned"

**Cause:** Equipment not linked to suppliers yet

**Fix:**
1. Verify migrations applied (check `supplier_id` column exists)
2. Re-import equipment CSV
3. Check console logs for matching results

### Issue: Wire drops disappeared after REPLACE

**Cause:** Should not happen anymore! Wire drops are preserved.

**Check:**
1. Console logs for wire drop restoration
2. If failed, check reason in failures array
3. Likely equipment removed from proposal

### Issue: Wrong vendor matched

**Cause:** Low confidence match (< 70%)

**Fix:**
1. Check console for match confidence
2. If needed, manually update supplier in Inventory Manager
3. Or adjust supplier name in suppliers table to match CSV

# Wire Drop Equipment Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎉 All Tasks Complete!

Successfully implemented all wire drop equipment enhancements including smart sorting, bidirectional navigation, and UniFi network integration.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Equipment → Wire Drop Navigation**
**File**: `src/components/EquipmentListPage.js`

Clicking equipment now shows all connected wire drops with clickable badges that navigate directly to wire drop detail pages.

### 2. **Equipment Display in Wire Drop Header**
**File**: `src/components/WireDropDetailEnhanced.js` (lines 1001-1053)

Wire drop header now shows:
- ✅ Green badge when equipment is connected
- ✅ Grey "Not Connected" badge when no equipment assigned
- ✅ Equipment name, manufacturer, and model

### 3. **Smart Equipment Sorting**
**File**: `src/components/WireDropDetailEnhanced.js` (lines 640-686, 1659-1801)

New equipment selector features:
- ✅ Same room equipment appears first
- ✅ Assigned items greyed out (75% opacity) and moved to bottom
- ✅ "Show More" button reveals equipment from other rooms
- ✅ Single-click selection (enforces 1 wire drop = 1 equipment)
- ✅ Clean card-based UI (replaced checkboxes)

### 4. **UniFi Database Migration**
**File**: `supabase/add_unifi_fields_to_equipment.sql`

Added fields to `project_equipment`:
- `unifi_client_mac` - MAC address
- `unifi_last_ip` - IP address
- `unifi_last_seen` - Last seen timestamp
- `unifi_data` - Full client data (JSONB)

### 5. **UniFi Client Selector Component**
**File**: `src/components/UniFiClientSelector.js` (NEW)

Features:
- ✅ Loads UniFi clients from API
- ✅ Dropdown with hostname, IP, MAC, online status
- ✅ Assigns client to equipment
- ✅ Auto-completes commission stage
- ✅ Shows current assignment with switch port info

### 6. **Commission Tab**
**File**: `src/components/WireDropDetailEnhanced.js` (lines 2136-2252)

New 4th tab:
- ✅ Network commissioning workflow
- ✅ Room end device + UniFi client selector
- ✅ Head end connection (placeholder for switch port selector)
- ✅ Auto-complete notice
- ✅ Integration with commission stage status

---

## 📋 Before Testing

### Run Database Migration
```bash
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f supabase/add_unifi_fields_to_equipment.sql
```

Or via Supabase dashboard SQL editor.

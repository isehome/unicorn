# Status Gauge System Analysis

## 🎯 Current State

### Where Gauges Are Used
1. **PM Dashboard** - 5 compact gauges per project (cached)
2. **PM Project Detail** - 6 full gauges with date inputs (NOT cached ❌)
3. **Technician Dashboard** - 5 compact gauges per project (sequential loading ❌)

### The 6 Milestone Gauges
1. **Planning & Design** - URL existence (0%, 50%, 100%)
2. **Prewire Prep** - Equipment ordered/received (binary threshold)
3. **Prewire** - Wire drop stage completion percentage
4. **Trim Prep** - Equipment ordered/received (binary threshold)
5. **Trim** - Wire drop stage completion percentage
6. **Commissioning** - Head-end equipment assignment (boolean)

## 🐌 Performance Issues Identified

### CRITICAL Issues:
1. **PMProjectViewEnhanced doesn't use cache**
   - Load time: ~3 seconds per project
   - Should be: ~300ms with cache

2. **TechnicianDashboard loads sequentially**
   - Current: 20-30 seconds for 20 projects
   - Should be: 3-5 seconds with parallel loading

3. **No cache invalidation after receiving items**
   - Gauges show stale data for 5 minutes
   - Should invalidate immediately on update

4. **Dashboard calculates 120+ queries for 20 projects**
   - 6 queries per project × 20 projects
   - Runs in parallel but still heavy

### MODERATE Issues:
5. **No debouncing on date input changes**
   - Typing a date triggers 6 calculations immediately
   - Should debounce 300ms

6. **PMProjectViewEnhanced makes 12 queries per load**
   - 6 for calculation + 6 for completion checks
   - Could be batched

## 💡 Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fixes (High Impact):
1. Add cache to PMProjectViewEnhanced
2. Fix TechnicianDashboard to use `Promise.all()`
3. Add cache invalidation to PartsReceivingPageNew
4. Debounce date input handlers

### Collapsible Grouping Options:

**Option A: Grouped by Phase**
```
┌─ PROCUREMENT PHASE (collapsed by default)
│  ├─ Prewire Prep [████████░░] 80%
│  └─ Trim Prep    [██████░░░░] 60%
│
┌─ INSTALLATION PHASE (expanded)
│  ├─ Prewire      [██████████] 100%
│  └─ Trim         [████░░░░░░] 40%
│
┌─ OTHER
   ├─ Planning & Design [██████████] 100%
   └─ Commissioning     [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%
```

**Option B: Chronological with Auto-Collapse**
```
✓ Planning & Design [100%] (auto-collapsed when 100%)
✓ Prewire Prep      [100%] (auto-collapsed when 100%)
▼ Prewire           [60%]  (expanded - in progress)
▼ Trim Prep         [40%]  (expanded - in progress)
▸ Trim              [0%]   (collapsed - not started)
▸ Commissioning     [0%]   (collapsed - not started)
```

**Option C: Smart Summary View**
```
┌─ OVERALL PROGRESS: 3/6 Complete, 2 In Progress
│
├─ ✓ Completed (3)     [Click to expand ▸]
│  └─ (collapsed by default)
│
├─ ⚡ In Progress (2)  [Click to collapse ▼]
│  ├─ Prewire      [60%] ████████████░░░░░░░░
│  └─ Trim Prep    [40%] ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░
│
└─ ○ Not Started (1)   [Click to expand ▸]
   └─ (collapsed by default)
```

## 🗂️ File Locations

| File | Purpose | Issues |
|------|---------|--------|
| `src/components/PMDashboard.js` (lines 468-492) | Dashboard gauges | ✅ Uses cache correctly |
| `src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js` (lines 2557-2665) | Project detail gauges | ❌ No cache, 12 queries |
| `src/components/TechnicianDashboardOptimized.js` (lines 123-150) | Tech dashboard | ❌ Sequential loading |
| `src/services/milestoneService.js` (lines 41-330) | Calculation logic | ✅ Well structured |
| `src/services/milestoneCacheService.js` | Cache layer | ✅ Works great |
| `src/components/PartsReceivingPageNew.js` (line 6) | Receiving page | ❌ Doesn't invalidate cache |

## 📊 Current vs Optimized Performance

| Scenario | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| PM Project Detail Load | 3s | 300ms | **10x faster** |
| Technician Dashboard (20 projects) | 20-30s | 3-5s | **6x faster** |
| After receiving items | Stale 5min | Instant | **Real-time** |
| Date input change | 6 queries | Debounced | **Smoother UX** |

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Decide on collapsible grouping approach (A, B, or C)
2. Implement performance fixes
3. Test with real project data
4. Deploy optimizations

# Savepoint: Progress Gauges Implementation
Date: October 6, 2025
Time: 10:25 AM CST

## Summary
Replaced "% complete" badges with three individual progress gauges (Prewire, Trim, Commission) across all project views in both PM and Technician dashboards.

## Changes Made

### 1. PM Dashboard (src/components/PMDashboard.js)
- Added `ProgressBar` component
- Imported `projectProgressService`
- Added `projectProgress` state to track progress for all projects
- Modified project cards to display three progress gauges on the right side
- Progress bars show color-coded completion (red < 33%, yellow 33-67%, green â‰¥ 67%)

### 2. PM Project Details Page (src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js)
- Added `ProgressBar` component
- Imported `projectProgressService`
- Added `projectProgress` state
- Added `loadProgress` function
- Modified "Time Tracking" section to "Time Tracking & Progress"
- Added progress gauges section above the checked-in users list
- Refresh button now updates both time data and progress

### 3. Technician Project Details Page (src/components/ProjectDetailView.js)
- Added `ProgressBar` component
- Imported `projectProgressService`
- Added `projectProgress` state
- Modified `loadProjectData` to fetch progress data
- **Replaced header** - Changed from full-width progress bar with "% complete" badge to:
  - Project name display at top
  - Three individual progress gauges (Prewire, Trim, Commission) below

## Technical Details

### Progress Bar Component
```javascript
const ProgressBar = ({ label, percentage }) => {
  const getBarColor = (percent) => {
    if (percent < 33) return 'bg-red-500';
    if (percent < 67) return 'bg-yellow-500';
    return 'bg-green-500';
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 w-20">{label}</span>
      <div className="flex-1 h-2 bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
        <div 
          className={`h-full transition-all duration-300 ${getBarColor(percentage)}`}
          style={{ width: `${percentage}%` }}
        />
      </div>
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 w-10 text-right">{percentage}%</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Progress Calculation
Progress is calculated using `projectProgressService.getProjectProgress(projectId)` which returns:
```javascript
{
  prewire: 0-100,    // Percentage of wire drops with prewire completed
  trim: 0-100,       // Percentage of wire drops with trim completed
  commission: 0-100  // Percentage of wire drops with commission completed
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Granular Visibility**: Users can now see progress for each phase individually instead of just an overall percentage
2. **Consistent UI**: Same gauge display across all project views (PM Dashboard, Technician Dashboard, Project Details)
3. **Color Coding**: Immediate visual feedback with red/yellow/green color scheme
4. **Responsive Design**: Gauges adapt to both light and dark themes

## Files Modified
- `src/components/PMDashboard.js`
- `src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js`
- `src/components/ProjectDetailView.js`

## Testing Checklist
- [x] PM Dashboard displays gauges for all projects
- [x] PM Project Details page shows gauges in Time Tracking section
- [x] Technician Project Details page header shows three gauges
- [x] Progress data loads automatically
- [x] Gauges update when progress changes
- [x] Dark mode support works correctly
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile

## Next Steps
None required - feature is complete and ready for production.

## Related Features
- Project Progress Service (already implemented)
- Wire Drop Stages (3-stage system: prewire, trim_out, commission)
- Time Tracking System

## Notes
- The old "% complete" badge calculation is still present in ProjectDetailView for backward compatibility with wire drops list, but is no longer displayed in the header
- Progress calculation is based on wire_drop_stages completion, providing accurate per-stage tracking

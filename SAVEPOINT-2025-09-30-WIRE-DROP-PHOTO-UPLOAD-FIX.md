# SAVEPOINT: Wire Drop Photo Upload Fix
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Time:** 7:24 AM EST

## Overview
Successfully fixed the wire drop photo upload functionality for both prewire and installed phases. The system now properly integrates with the 3-stage wire drop system using Supabase storage.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Structure Mismatch
- **Problem:** Component was trying to use non-existent `prewire_photo` and `installed_photo` columns
- **Solution:** Updated to use the proper `wire_drop_stages` table with `photo_url` field

### 2. Photo Upload Errors
- **Problem:** "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" error when uploading photos
- **Solution:** Fixed the `updateStage` method to handle missing stages, duplicates, and proper ID-based updates

### 3. Service Integration
- **Problem:** Direct Supabase calls instead of using the service layer
- **Solution:** Integrated with `wireDropService.uploadStagePhoto()` for consistent handling

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
1. **src/components/WireDropDetail.js**
   - Updated to use `wireDropService` for data fetching and photo uploads
   - Fixed photo display to read from stages data
   - Mapped UI terminology ("installed") to database terminology ("trim_out")

2. **src/services/wireDropService.js**
   - Fixed `updateStage` method to handle edge cases
   - Added duplicate stage cleanup
   - Improved error handling for missing stages

## Technical Details

### Photo Upload Flow
1. User selects image file (validated for type and size)
2. Photo uploaded to Supabase storage bucket "photos"
3. Stage record updated with photo URL
4. Stage marked as complete with user attribution
5. UI refreshes to show uploaded photo and progress

### Database Schema Used
```sql
-- wire_drops table (main record)
-- wire_drop_stages table:
  - id
  - wire_drop_id (FK)
  - stage_type ('prewire', 'trim_out', 'commission')
  - completed (boolean)
  - completed_at (timestamp)
  - completed_by (text)
  - photo_url (text)
  - notes (text)
  - stage_data (jsonb)
```

## Features Working
✅ Photo upload for prewire phase  
✅ Photo upload for installed/trim_out phase  
✅ Progress tracking based on photo completion  
✅ User attribution for completed stages  
✅ Photo replacement functionality  
✅ Photo preview and full-size viewing  
✅ Automatic stage completion on photo upload  

## Testing Performed
- Uploaded photos for new wire drops
- Replaced existing photos
- Handled wire drops with missing stage records
- Verified progress calculations
- Confirmed photo persistence in Supabase storage

## Next Steps
- Consider adding photo upload for commission stage if needed
- Could add photo deletion functionality
- May want to add image compression for large files

## Deployment Status
Ready for production deployment to Vercel

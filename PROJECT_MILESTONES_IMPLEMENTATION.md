# Project Milestones System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive automated project milestone tracking system has been implemented to replace the legacy phase-based system. The new system provides fixed milestone types with automatic completion tracking based on existing project data.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Structure (`supabase/project_milestones_migration.sql`)
- **Table**: `project_milestones` - Stores milestone data for each project
- **Function**: `check_milestone_completion()` - Checks completion status based on project data
- **Trigger**: `update_dependent_milestone_dates()` - Auto-calculates prep milestone dates
- **View**: `project_milestone_status` - Provides enhanced milestone information with labels

### 2. Milestone Service (`src/services/milestoneService.js`)
Complete service class with the following methods:
- `getProjectMilestones(projectId)` - Fetches all milestones for a project
- `initializeProjectMilestones(projectId)` - Creates initial milestone records
- `updateMilestone(milestoneId, data)` - Updates milestone data
- `checkMilestoneCompletion(projectId, milestoneType)` - Checks completion status
- `checkAllMilestones(projectId)` - Batch checks all milestones
- `updateMilestoneDate(milestoneId, dateField, value)` - Updates target/actual dates
- `toggleManualCompletion(milestoneId, completed)` - Manual completion toggle
- `getProjectCompletionStats(projectId)` - Gets overall completion statistics
- `formatMilestone(milestone)` - Formats milestone for display with labels and helper text

### 3. UI Implementation (`src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js`)
- Integrated new milestone system into the project view
- Added state management for milestones
- Created comprehensive UI with:
  - Progress overview (completed/in-progress/not scheduled)
  - Individual milestone cards with completion status
  - Automatic vs manual completion indicators
  - Date management (target and actual dates)
  - Completion requirement details
  - Auto-refresh functionality
- Retained legacy phase milestone section as fallback

## Milestone Types and Completion Logic

### 1. Planning & Design
- **Auto-completion**: When both Lucid diagram URL and Portal proposal URL exist
- **Progress**: 50% for one URL, 100% for both

### 2. Prewire Prep
- **Auto-calculated date**: Prewire date - 14 days
- **Auto-completion**: All prewire-required equipment ordered AND received
- **Progress**: Based on ordering/receiving status

### 3. Prewire
- **Auto-completion**: At least one prewire photo uploaded
- **Progress**: Percentage of wire drops with prewire photos

### 4. Trim Prep
- **Auto-calculated date**: Trim date - 14 days
- **Auto-completion**: All non-prewire equipment ordered AND received
- **Progress**: Based on ordering/receiving status

### 5. Trim
- **Auto-completion**: Trim photos uploaded AND room equipment configured
- **Progress**: 50% for either condition, 100% for both

### 6. Commissioning
- **Auto-completion**: Head-end equipment configured
- **Progress**: 0% or 100% based on presence of head-end config

### 7. Handoff/Training
- **Manual completion only**: PM must manually mark as complete
- **Progress**: 0% or 100% based on manual completion

## Features

### Automatic Features
- **Completion Tracking**: Automatically checks project data to determine milestone completion
- **Date Dependencies**: Prep milestones automatically calculate dates based on main milestones
- **Progress Calculation**: Each milestone tracks percentage completion
- **Real-time Updates**: UI refreshes when underlying data changes

### Manual Controls
- **Date Override**: PMs can manually set target and actual dates
- **Manual Completion**: Handoff/Training milestone requires manual completion
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh to check latest completion status

## Database Migration Status
To apply the migration to your database, run:
```sql
-- Execute the migration file
\i supabase/project_milestones_migration.sql
```

## Usage

### Initialize Milestones for a Project
When viewing a project for the first time with the new system, click "Initialize Milestones" to create the milestone records.

### Automatic Tracking
The system will automatically track completion based on:
- Equipment ordering/receiving status (from project_equipment table)
- Photo uploads (from wire_drop_stages table)
- URL configuration (from projects table)
- Head-end/room-end equipment (from wire_drop_head_end and wire_drop_room_end tables)

### Date Management
- Set Prewire date → Prewire Prep automatically set to 14 days before
- Set Trim date → Trim Prep automatically set to 14 days before
- Dates can be manually overridden if needed

## Integration Points

The milestone system integrates with:
- **Projects**: Reads URLs for Planning milestone
- **Project Equipment**: Tracks ordering/receiving for Prep milestones
- **Wire Drops**: Monitors photo uploads and equipment configuration
- **Wire Drop Stages**: Checks for prewire and trim photos
- **Wire Drop Head/Room End**: Validates equipment installation

## Benefits

1. **Automated Tracking**: Reduces manual updates by automatically checking completion
2. **Consistent Structure**: Fixed milestone types across all projects
3. **Clear Requirements**: Each milestone has defined completion criteria
4. **Progress Visibility**: Percentage completion for each phase
5. **Date Dependencies**: Prep milestones automatically scheduled
6. **Flexible Override**: PMs can manually adjust when needed

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration applied successfully
- [ ] Milestones initialize for new projects
- [ ] Planning milestone completes when URLs added
- [ ] Prewire Prep date auto-calculates from Prewire date
- [ ] Equipment ordering/receiving updates Prep milestones
- [ ] Photo uploads trigger milestone completion
- [ ] Manual completion works for Handoff/Training
- [ ] Progress percentages calculate correctly
- [ ] UI updates reflect milestone changes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Email notifications when milestones complete
2. Milestone dependencies (can't complete Trim without Prewire)
3. Historical milestone tracking and reporting
4. Milestone templates for different project types
5. Integration with scheduling systems
6. Automated reminders for upcoming milestones

# Vercel Deployment Fix - October 20, 2025

## Issue
Vercel deployment failed with "Build Failed" error after SharePoint migration implementation. Build logs showed source map warnings from `react-zoom-pan-pinch` library in node_modules.

## Root Cause
While the React build was compiling successfully, source map parsing warnings were causing the Vercel build to fail. These warnings typically shouldn't cause failures, but in this case they appeared to be treated as critical errors by Vercel.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json
Added environment variables to disable source map generation and suppress warnings:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "CI": "false",
      "GENERATE_SOURCEMAP": "false",
      "DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN": "true"
    }
  },
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.js": {
      "memory": 1024,
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated package.json Build Script
Explicitly disabled source map generation in the build command:
```json
"build": "GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false CI=false react-scripts build"
```

## Changes Committed
- **Commit**: 7c863ac
- **Message**: "Fix Vercel deployment: disable source maps and suppress warnings"
- **Files**: vercel.json, package.json
- **Pushed to**: main branch

## Expected Result
- Vercel automatic deployment should trigger
- Build should complete without source map warnings
- Application should deploy successfully

## Verification Steps
1. Check Vercel dashboard for new deployment triggered by commit 7c863ac
2. Monitor build logs to confirm no source map errors
3. Verify deployment status shows "Ready"
4. Test SharePoint migration features in production

## Fallback Options (if deployment still fails)
1. Retry deployment manually from Vercel dashboard
2. Check for memory/timeout issues during build
3. Review complete build logs in Vercel for actual error
4. Consider updating react-zoom-pan-pinch to latest version
5. Temporarily remove react-zoom-pan-pinch if issue persists

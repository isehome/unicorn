# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The app was not fully logging users in due to an issue in the OAuth callback handler.

## Root Cause
The `AuthCallback.js` component was using an outdated syntax for the Supabase `exchangeCodeForSession()` method. It was passing the URL as a parameter:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(url)
```

However, in recent versions of Supabase (v2.x), the `exchangeCodeForSession()` method doesn't accept any parameters - it automatically reads the authorization code from the current browser URL.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `AuthCallback.js` component to use the correct syntax:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()
```

## Authentication Flow
The corrected authentication flow now works as follows:

1. **Login Initiation** (`Login.js`):
   - User clicks "Continue with Microsoft 365"
   - App calls `signInWithMicrosoft()` which uses Supabase OAuth
   - Browser redirects to Microsoft login page

2. **Microsoft Authentication**:
   - User logs in with Microsoft credentials
   - Microsoft redirects back to `/auth/callback` with authorization code

3. **Callback Processing** (`AuthCallback.js`):
   - Component checks for existing session
   - If no session, checks for auth code in URL
   - Calls `exchangeCodeForSession()` (without parameters)
   - Supabase automatically extracts code from URL and exchanges it for session
   - On success, user is redirected to home page

4. **Session Management** (`AuthContext.js`):
   - Auth context maintains session state
   - Auto-refresh is configured for token renewal
   - Profile data is loaded from database

## Additional Features
- **Retry Logic**: The callback includes retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions are stored in localStorage for persistence

## Testing the Fix
To verify the authentication is working:
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click "Continue with Microsoft 365"
4. Complete Microsoft login
5. Verify redirect to home page with active session

## Configuration Requirements
Ensure these environment variables are properly set:
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

Also verify in your Supabase dashboard:
- Azure provider is configured in Authentication settings
- Redirect URL is set to `{your-domain}/auth/callback`
- Required scopes are configured for Microsoft Graph API access

# Lucid Migration Status & Next Steps

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- SharePoint migration infrastructure is fully implemented
- Thumbnail caching system is operational
- Lucid diagram fetching and shape extraction works correctly
- Wire drop creation from Lucid shapes is functional
- Room matching and alias system is working

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Functionality (Due to Missing Database Columns)
The `PMProjectViewEnhanced.js` component is currently configured to work with **ONLY** the existing database columns:
- `name` - Wire drop name
- `room_name` - Room name from Lucid
- `location` - Location details
- `type` - Wire type (defaults to CAT6)
- `lucid_shape_id` - Link to Lucid shape
- `lucid_page_id` - Link to Lucid page
- `project_room_id` - Link to project room

### üîí Enhanced Fields NOT Currently Used
These fields are extracted from Lucid but NOT saved to database (because columns don't exist yet):
- `drop_name` - Drop identifier (e.g., "Living Room TV")
- `drop_type` - Type of drop (e.g., "Keypad", "TV", "Camera")
- `wire_type` - Cable type details (e.g., "18/4", "CAT6", "Fiber")
- `install_note` - Installation notes from diagram
- `device` - Device type
- `shape_color` - Primary color from Lucid shape
- `shape_fill_color` - Fill color from Lucid shape
- `shape_line_color` - Line color from Lucid shape
- `lucid_synced_at` - Timestamp of last sync

## How to Apply the Migration

**See the detailed guide:** `LUCID_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md`

### Quick Steps:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard (https://app.supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/lucid_wire_drop_fields_migration.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click Run
6. Verify new columns appear in wire_drops table

## What Changes After Migration

Once the migration is successfully applied, the following enhancements will be available:

### 1. Enhanced Wire Drop Data
Wire drops created from Lucid will store ALL custom properties:
```javascript
// BEFORE MIGRATION (Current)
{
  name: "Drop Name",
  room_name: "Living Room",
  location: "Living Room",
  type: "CAT6",
  lucid_shape_id: "shape_123",
  lucid_page_id: "page_456",
  project_room_id: "room_789"
}

// AFTER MIGRATION (Enhanced)
{
  name: "Drop Name",
  drop_name: "Living Room TV",          // ‚ú® NEW
  room_name: "Living Room",
  location: "Living Room",
  type: "CAT6",
  drop_type: "TV",                      // ‚ú® NEW
  wire_type: "CAT6 Plenum",            // ‚ú® NEW - More detailed
  install_note: "Behind TV mount",      // ‚ú® NEW
  device: "Samsung 75\" TV",           // ‚ú® NEW
  shape_color: "#4285F4",              // ‚ú® NEW
  shape_fill_color: "#E8F0FE",         // ‚ú® NEW
  shape_line_color: "#1967D2",         // ‚ú® NEW
  lucid_shape_id: "shape_123",
  lucid_page_id: "page_456",
  project_room_id: "room_789",
  lucid_synced_at: "2025-10-20T13:15:00Z"  // ‚ú® NEW
}
```

### 2. UI Enhancements
- Lucid-sourced data will be displayed in **green** to indicate it came from the diagram
- Better filtering by drop type (TV, Keypad, Camera, etc.)
- Better filtering by wire type
- Visual indicators using shape colors from diagram
- Sync timestamps to track when data was last updated from Lucid

### 3. Code Changes to Enable
After migration is applied, update `PMProjectViewEnhanced.js`:

**Current wire drop creation (lines ~1240-1250):**
```javascript
const wireDropData = {
  name: dropName,
  room_name: canonicalRoomName,
  location: locationValue,
  type: wireType,
  lucid_shape_id: shape.id,
  lucid_page_id: shape.pageId || null,
  project_room_id: resolvedRoom?.room?.id || null
};
```

**Enhanced wire drop creation (after migration):**
```javascript
const wireDropData = {
  name: dropName,
  drop_name: getShapeCustomValue(shape, 'Drop Name') || dropName,
  room_name: canonicalRoomName,
  location: locationValue,
  type: wireType,
  drop_type: extractShapeDropType(shape),
  wire_type: extractShapeWireType(shape),
  install_note: getShapeCustomValue(shape, 'Install Note') || 
                getShapeCustomValue(shape, 'Note') || null,
  device: extractShapeDevice(shape),
  shape_color: shape.style?.strokeColor || null,
  shape_fill_color: shape.style?.fillColor || null,
  shape_line_color: shape.style?.lineColor || null,
  lucid_shape_id: shape.id,
  lucid_page_id: shape.pageId || null,
  project_room_id: resolvedRoom?.room?.id || null,
  lucid_synced_at: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

### 4. Update Operations
When re-importing from Lucid, existing wire drops will be updated with latest data:
```javascript
// Update operation will now include:
.update({
  name: dropName,
  drop_name: getShapeCustomValue(shape, 'Drop Name') || dropName,
  room_name: canonicalRoomName,
  location: locationValue,
  type: wireType,
  drop_type: extractShapeDropType(shape),
  wire_type: extractShapeWireType(shape),
  install_note: getShapeCustomValue(shape, 'Install Note') || null,
  device: extractShapeDevice(shape),
  shape_color: shape.style?.strokeColor || null,
  shape_fill_color: shape.style?.fillColor || null,
  shape_line_color: shape.style?.lineColor || null,
  lucid_synced_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

## Testing After Migration

1. **Verify Database Schema**
   - Check that all new columns exist in wire_drops table
   - Verify indexes were created
   - Confirm trigger is working for updated_at

2. **Test Wire Drop Creation**
   - Create a new wire drop from Lucid
   - Verify all new fields are populated
   - Check that lucid_synced_at timestamp is set

3. **Test Wire Drop Updates**
   - Update a Lucid shape's custom properties
   - Re-fetch and update the wire drop
   - Verify changes are reflected
   - Confirm lucid_synced_at was updated

4. **Test Filtering**
   - Try filtering by drop_type
   - Try filtering by wire_type
   - Verify search works with new fields

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
- Check Supabase project logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure you have proper permissions (project owner or admin)
- Verify no conflicting column names exist
- Try running each ALTER TABLE statement individually

### If Data Isn't Saving
- Verify RLS policies allow INSERT/UPDATE with new columns
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify the code changes were deployed to production

### If UI Doesn't Show Green Text
- Clear browser cache
- Verify the enhanced code was deployed
- Check that lucid_synced_at field has a value

## Files to Update After Migration

1. **src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js**
   - Update wire drop creation logic (around line 1240)
   - Update wire drop update logic (around line 1220)
   
2. **src/components/WireDropDetailEnhanced.js**
   - Add display of new fields
   - Add green highlighting for Lucid-sourced fields
   - Show lucid_synced_at timestamp

3. **src/components/WireDropsList.js**
   - Update filters to include drop_type and wire_type
   - Display drop_type and wire_type in list view

## Current Workaround

Until the migration is applied, the system will:
- ‚úÖ Continue to work with existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Create wire drops with basic fields
- ‚úÖ Link Lucid shapes to wire drops
- ‚úÖ Match rooms and create aliases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not save enhanced Lucid properties
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not track sync timestamps

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `LUCID_MIGRATION_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed migration steps
2. Review Supabase project logs
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify database permissions

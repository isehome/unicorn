# Wire Drop Naming Implementation Status

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The automatic wire drop naming convention has been fully implemented across all components.

## How It Works

### Naming Format
- **Pattern**: `Room Name + Drop Type + Number`
- **Example**: "Living Room Speaker 1", "Living Room Speaker 2", "Master Bedroom Camera 1"

### Key Components Updated

#### 1. **wireDropService.js** ✅
- Added `generateDropName()` function that:
  - Takes projectId, roomName, and dropType as parameters
  - Queries existing wire drops for the same room/type combination
  - Finds the next available number (handles gaps in sequence)
  - Returns formatted name like "Living Room Speaker 1"
- `createWireDrop()` automatically calls `generateDropName()` when drop_name is null

#### 2. **WireDropNew.js** (Technician UI) ✅
- Complete UI overhaul with:
  - **Room Selection**: Dropdown to select from project rooms
  - **Drop Type Quick Select**: Button grid for common types (Speaker, Display, Camera, etc.)
  - **Real-time Name Preview**: Shows the auto-generated name before creation
  - **Simplified Wire Type**: Dropdown for cable types (CAT6, Fiber, etc.)
  - Clean, modern interface optimized for technicians

#### 3. **PMProjectViewEnhanced.js** (Lucid Import) ✅
- `handleCreateWireDropsFromSelected()` updated to:
  - Extract room name and drop type from Lucid shapes
  - Pass these to wireDropService for auto-naming
  - Updates existing drops with new names if room/type changed

#### 4. **ProjectDetailView.js** (Display) ✅
- Shows wire drops with:
  - Room name prominently displayed
  - Drop name and type shown
  - Color indicators from Lucid shapes
  - Completion percentage for each stage

## How to Use

### Manual Creation (Technician Side)
1. Navigate to "Add Wire Drop" from project view
2. Select the room from dropdown
3. Click the drop type button (e.g., "Speaker")
4. See the auto-generated name preview (e.g., "Living Room Speaker 1")
5. Optionally select cable type
6. Click "Create Wire Drop"

### Bulk Import from Lucid
1. In PM Project View, ensure Wiring Diagram URL is set
2. Click "Fetch Shape Data"
3. Select shapes to import
4. Click "Create X Wire Drops"
5. Names will be auto-generated based on room and drop type from Lucid

## Testing the Implementation

### To verify the changes are working:

1. **Check Current Deployment**:
   - The app is running on `npm start`
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port it's running on)
   - Hard refresh the browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

2. **Test Manual Creation**:
   - Go to any project
   - Click "Wire Drops" section
   - Click "Add Wire Drop"
   - Select a room and drop type
   - Verify the name preview appears

3. **Test Lucid Import**:
   - Go to PM Project View for a project
   - Ensure project has a Lucid wiring diagram URL
   - Click "Fetch Shape Data"
   - Check that wire drops are created with proper names

## Troubleshooting

If changes aren't visible:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   ```
   Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete → Clear browsing data
   Safari: Develop → Empty Caches
   ```

2. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in Console tab

3. **Restart the Development Server**:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   - Run `npm start` again

4. **Check Database**:
   - Ensure wire_drops table has the required columns:
     - room_name
     - drop_type
     - drop_name

## Database Requirements

The implementation relies on these wire_drops table columns:
- `room_name` (text) - The room where the drop is located
- `drop_type` (text) - Type of drop (Speaker, Camera, etc.)
- `drop_name` (text) - Auto-generated or custom name
- `wire_type` (text) - Cable type (CAT6, Fiber, etc.)

## Next Steps

If you're still not seeing the changes:
1. Check if you're looking at the correct environment (dev vs production)
2. Verify the database has the latest schema updates
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Try creating a new wire drop to test the functionality

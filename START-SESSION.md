# UNICORN SESSION STARTER

> **Claude: Read `QUICKSTART.md` NOW.**

That file contains everything you need for development - brand colors, patterns, services, mobile UX rules, and the complete checklist.

## After Reading QUICKSTART.md

If your task involves a specific domain, also read the relevant topic doc:

| Working on... | Also read... |
|---------------|--------------|
| Wire drops, stages, prewire, trim | `docs/WIRE_DROPS.md` |
| Equipment, parts, CSV import | `docs/EQUIPMENT.md` |
| Progress gauges, milestones | `docs/MILESTONES.md` |
| Purchase orders, procurement | `docs/PROCUREMENT.md` |
| Photos, SharePoint, thumbnails | `docs/SHAREPOINT.md` |
| External portals, public pages | `docs/EXTERNAL-PORTALS.md` |
| Voice AI, copilot, Gemini | `docs/VOICE-AI-REFERENCE.md` |
| Phone agent, Sarah, Retell | `docs/RETELL_AI_AGENT.md` |
| Home Assistant, HA | `docs/WORKSTREAM_2_HOME_ASSISTANT_INTEGRATION.md` |
| Database, schema, RLS | `docs/DATABASE-SCHEMA-MAP.md` |
| Styling, UI, theme | `docs/STYLES.md` |
| Bugs, errors, debugging | `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` |

## NEVER

- Read `AGENT.md` for routine dev (300KB, exhausts context)
- Use `green-*` or `emerald-*` Tailwind classes
- Use `gray-*` classes (use `zinc-*`)
- Direct Supabase in components (use services)

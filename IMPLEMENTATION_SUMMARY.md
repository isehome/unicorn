# Quantity-Based Status Gauge Implementation - Summary

## What Was Built

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `ordered_quantity` and `received_quantity` fields to `project_equipment`
   - Created trigger to auto-sync legacy boolean flags
   - Added validation constraints
   - Migration script to convert existing data

2. **Status Gauge Calculation Refactor**
   - Changed from "all-or-nothing" to **additive** formula
   - **New Formula**: `(ordered × 50%) + (received × 50%)`
   - Updated both Prewire Prep and Trim Prep calculations
   - Now uses quantity totals instead of counting line items

3. **Technician Parts Receiving UI**
   - New page: `/projects/:projectId/receiving`
   - Phase toggle: Prewire vs. Trim
   - **"Receive All" button**: Bulk receive all pending items
   - **Per-item quick receive**: One-click receive for individual items
   - **Editable quantity fields**: Click to enter partial quantities
   - **Shortage warnings**: Yellow highlights when received < ordered

4. **Service Layer Enhancements**
   - `updateProcurementQuantities()`: Update ordered/received quantities
   - `receiveAllForPhase()`: Bulk receive all items in a phase
   - Validation: Can't receive more than ordered

## File Changes

### New Files Created
1. `/supabase/add_quantity_tracking.sql` - Database migration
2. `/src/components/PartsReceivingPage.js` - Technician receiving UI
3. `/STATUS_GAUGE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive system documentation
4. `/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `/src/services/milestoneService.js` - Updated calculation logic for both prep phases
2. `/src/services/projectEquipmentService.js` - Added quantity update methods
3. `/src/App.js` - Added route for receiving page
4. `/src/components/EquipmentListPage.js` - Added "Receive Items" button to header
5. `/src/components/ProjectDetailView.js` - Added "Receive Items" quick action card

## How It Works

### Workflow Example: Prewire Phase

```
1. PM imports CSV → planned_quantity = 200 CAT6 cables
2. PM marks CAT6 as required_for_prewire in global catalog
3. PM orders equipment → ordered_quantity = 200
   ➜ Status gauge: 50% (ordered counts for half)

4. Technician receives shipment
   Option A: Full shipment arrives
     - Clicks "Receive All" → received_quantity = 200
     - ➜ Status gauge: 100% ✅

   Option B: Partial shipment arrives (150 cables)
     - Clicks received field, types "150"
     - ➜ Status gauge: 87.5% ⚠️
     - Warning shows: "Shortage: 50 units"
     - PM sees shortage, orders 50 more
     - Technician receives remaining 50
     - ➜ Status gauge: 100% ✅
```

## Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
cd supabase
psql -h your-db-host -d your-db-name -f add_quantity_tracking.sql
```

This will:
- Add new quantity columns
- Migrate existing boolean data to quantities
- Create validation triggers

### Step 2: Test on Staging
1. Import a test project CSV
2. Mark some items as `required_for_prewire = true`
3. Navigate to `/projects/{id}/receiving`
4. Test ordering and receiving flows
5. Verify status gauges update correctly

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
1. Run migration on production database
2. Deploy updated code
3. Clear milestone cache: `milestoneCacheService.invalidate()`
4. Monitor status gauges on PM Dashboard

## Key Benefits

### For Project Managers
✅ **Progressive visibility**: See 50% when items are ordered (not 0%)
✅ **Shortage detection**: Yellow warnings when shipments are short
✅ **Phase separation**: Prewire items separate from trim items
✅ **Global catalog**: Set `required_for_prewire` once, applies to all projects

### For Technicians
✅ **Fast bulk receive**: "Receive All" button for full shipments
✅ **Easy partial entry**: Click and type partial quantities
✅ **Phase filtering**: Only see prewire items when receiving prewire
✅ **Visual feedback**: Green = fully received, Yellow = partial, Gray = pending

### For the System
✅ **Accurate tracking**: Quantity-based instead of boolean
✅ **Backward compatible**: Legacy boolean flags still work
✅ **Scalable**: Ready for future inventory features
✅ **Consistent**: Same calculation everywhere

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run database migration successfully
- [ ] Import test CSV with mixed prewire/trim items
- [ ] Verify Prewire Prep gauge calculates correctly
- [ ] Verify Trim Prep gauge calculates correctly
- [ ] Test "Receive All" button
- [ ] Test partial receive with shortage warning
- [ ] Test phase toggle (Prewire/Trim)
- [ ] Verify PM Dashboard gauges update after receiving
- [ ] Test on mobile device (responsive UI)
- [ ] Clear cache and verify refresh works

## Questions Answered

### Q: How do we track inventory per project vs. globally?
**A**: Currently per-project. Global warehouse is Phase 2 (see documentation).

### Q: Can we track quantities per wire drop/room?
**A**: Not yet. This is Phase 3 if needed. Current scope is project-level only.

### Q: What happens to existing projects with boolean flags?
**A**: Migration script converts them:
- `ordered_confirmed = true` → `ordered_quantity = planned_quantity`
- `onsite_confirmed = true` → `received_quantity = planned_quantity`
- Trigger keeps them in sync going forward

### Q: How do technicians know what to receive?
**A**: Navigate to `/projects/:projectId/receiving`, select phase (Prewire or Trim), and all items that have been ordered are displayed.

### Q: What if we receive more than ordered?
**A**: Database constraint prevents this. Technician must first update `ordered_quantity`.

## Future Enhancements (Not Built Yet)

These were discussed but marked as future work:

1. **Notification System**
   - Email PM when shortage detected
   - Push notifications for critical items

2. **Global Warehouse Inventory**
   - Track `quantity_on_hand` globally
   - Reserve quantities for projects
   - Auto-allocate before ordering

3. **Per-Room Tracking**
   - Track which items are in which room
   - Useful for large multi-building projects

4. **History & Audit Log**
   - Track who received items and when
   - Shipment tracking numbers
   - Vendor information

# FINAL FIX for Secure Data RLS Error

## The Problem
You're getting "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'project_secure_data'" even after running multiple fixes. This is likely because:
1. The authentication state isn't being properly recognized by Supabase
2. PKCE auth flow may be creating edge cases with RLS policies
3. Previous policy fixes may not have been completely applied

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Temporarily Disable RLS (Fastest Fix)
This will immediately fix the issue for development:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Run this SQL:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of:
   supabase/DISABLE_RLS_TEMPORARY.sql
   ```
3. **Look for the output** - it should show:
   - All 4 tables with "RLS DISABLED (Open Access)"
   - A success message about creating a test entry
4. **Test in your app** - The secure data section should now work

### Option 2: Fix RLS Policies (If Option 1 doesn't work)
If you need RLS enabled but with permissive policies:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Run this SQL:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of:
   supabase/fix_secure_data_rls_COMPLETE.sql
   ```
3. This creates policies that allow both `anon` and `authenticated` users

## VERIFY THE FIX

### Quick Test in SQL Editor
Run this test query to verify you can insert data:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.project_secure_data (
    project_id,
    data_type,
    name,
    username,
    password,
    notes
) VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM projects LIMIT 1),
    'credentials',
    'Manual Test Entry',
    'testuser',
    'testpass',
    'If this inserts successfully, the fix worked!'
) RETURNING *;
```

If this works, your app should work too.

### Test in the App
1. Navigate to a project in the technician view
2. Click on "Secure Data" 
3. Click "Add Secure Data"
4. Fill in the form and save
5. It should save without errors

## IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Debug Steps:
1. **Check if RLS is actually disabled:**
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
   FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
   AND tablename = 'project_secure_data';
   ```
   - If `rowsecurity` is `false`, RLS is disabled and should work
   - If `rowsecurity` is `true`, RLS is still enabled

2. **Force disable RLS again:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.project_secure_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

3. **Check for other errors:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Try to save secure data
   - Look for any errors that aren't RLS-related

## FILES CREATED
- `supabase/DISABLE_RLS_TEMPORARY.sql` - Disables RLS completely (development only)
- `supabase/ENABLE_RLS_PRODUCTION.sql` - Re-enables RLS with permissive policies
- `supabase/fix_secure_data_rls_COMPLETE.sql` - Fixes RLS with proper policies for both anon/authenticated
- `src/components/SecureDataDebug.js` - Debug component (not currently integrated)

## PERMANENT SOLUTION
Once testing is complete, you can re-enable RLS with proper policies:
```sql
-- Run the contents of:
supabase/ENABLE_RLS_PRODUCTION.sql
```

This will restore security while still allowing the app to function properly.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
The DISABLE_RLS_TEMPORARY.sql solution completely removes security from these tables. This is acceptable for development but should NEVER be used in production. Always re-enable RLS with proper policies before deploying.

# Unified Progress Gauges Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified progress gauge system that merges the PM project progress bars with project milestones, providing consistent, real-time status tracking across the application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Components & Services

#### UnifiedProgressGauge Component (`src/components/UnifiedProgressGauge.js`)
- Displays progress with **gradient color** from Red (0%) → Yellow (50%) → Green (100%)
- Two modes:
  - **Full view**: Shows gauge, target/actual dates, and helper text
  - **Compact view**: Shows only gauge bar and percentage (for list displays)
- Auto-calculated fields are marked and disabled for editing
- Integrates date inputs for easy milestone management

#### Enhanced Milestone Service (`src/services/milestoneService.js`)
Added real-time percentage calculation methods:

**Planning & Design** (0% or 50% or 100%)
- 100% when BOTH `wiring_diagram_url` AND `portal_proposal_url` exist
- 50% when only one exists
- 0% when neither exists

**Prewire Prep** (0-100% calculated)
- Calculates: (Equipment with `required_for_prewire=true` that are BOTH ordered AND received) / (Total prewire items) × 100
- Treats equipment without the flag as trim items
- Target date: Auto-calculated as Prewire actual date - 14 days

**Prewire** (0-100% calculated)
- Calculates: (Wire drops with prewire photo uploaded) / (Total wire drops) × 100
- Counts wire_drop_stages where `stage_type='prewire'` AND (`completed=true` OR `photo_url` exists)

**Trim Prep** (0-100% calculated)
- Calculates: (Equipment with `required_for_prewire=false/null` that are BOTH ordered AND received) / (Total trim items) × 100
- Target date: Auto-calculated as Trim actual date - 14 days

**Trim** (0-100% calculated)
- Calculates: (Wire drops with trim completed) / (Total wire drops) × 100
- Counts wire_drop_stages where `stage_type='trim_out'` AND (`completed=true` OR (`photo_url` exists AND `equipment_attached=true`))

**Commissioning** (0% or 100%)
- 100% when ANY equipment is attached to a head-end room
- 0% otherwise
- Checks `project_rooms.is_headend=true` and `project_equipment.project_room_id`

### 2. Updated Components

#### PMProjectViewEnhanced (`src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js`)
- **REPLACED** old 5-gauge section (Prewire/Trim/Commission/Ordered/Received)
- **WITH** new unified 6-gauge system matching your screenshot:
  1. Planning and Design
  2. Prewire Prep (with Auto badge)
  3. Prewire
  4. Trim Prep (with Auto badge)
  5. Trim
  6. Commissioning
- Each gauge shows:
  - Progress bar with gradient color
  - Target Date input (auto-calculated for Prep milestones)
  - Actual Date input
  - Helper text explaining completion criteria
- **REMOVED** old "Project Milestones" section (was duplicate)
- Kept "Legacy Phase Milestones" table for backward compatibility

#### PMDashboard (`src/components/PMDashboard.js`)
- Updated project list cards to show **5 compact gauges** instead of 3:
  1. Prewire Prep
  2. Prewire
  3. Trim Prep
  4. Trim
  5. Commissioning
- Uses gradient colors for visual consistency
- Falls back to old progress bars if milestone data unavailable

#### TechnicianDashboardOptimized (`src/components/TechnicianDashboardOptimized.js`)
- Updated project list cards to show **5 compact gauges** instead of 3:
  1. Prewire Prep
  2. Prewire
  3. Trim Prep
  4. Trim
  5. Commissioning
- Uses gradient colors for visual consistency
- Falls back to old progress bars if milestone data unavailable

### 3. Auto-Date Calculation Logic

Implemented automatic target date updates in `milestoneService.updateMilestoneDate()`:

**When Prewire actual date is set:**
- Prewire Prep target_date automatically updates to 14 days before Prewire date
- Marked as `auto_calculated=true`
- User cannot edit Prewire Prep target date manually

**When Trim actual date is set:**
- Trim Prep target_date automatically updates to 14 days before Trim date
- Marked as `auto_calculated=true`
- User cannot edit Trim Prep target date manually

## Color Gradient Formula

The progress bars use a smooth color transition:
- **0-50%**: Red (#EF4444) to Yellow (#F5A50B)
- **50-100%**: Yellow (#F5A50B) to Green (#10B981)

Calculation uses RGB interpolation for smooth transitions.

## Data Flow

### On Page Load:
1. Load project data
2. Calculate all milestone percentages via `milestoneService.calculateAllPercentages()`
3. Display unified gauges with current completion status
4. Load milestone dates from database

### On Date Change:
1. User updates Prewire/Trim actual date
2. System saves the date
3. Auto-triggers Prep milestone target date calculation
4. Refreshes all milestones to show updated dates
5. Percentages recalculate based on current equipment/photo status

### On Equipment/Photo Changes:
1. Equipment ordered/received status changes
2. Photos uploaded to wire drop stages
3. Equipment attached to rooms
4. Next page refresh will show updated percentages
5. Refresh button available for immediate updates

## Equipment Classification Impact

The system properly handles the `required_for_prewire` flag:
- **`true`**: Counts toward Prewire Prep percentage
- **`false` or `null`**: Counts toward Trim Prep percentage
- **Labor items**: Excluded from both calculations

This aligns with the breakdown you mentioned where equipment is split between Prewire Prep needs and Trim needs.

## User Experience Improvements

### PM View (Detail Page)
- Single, unified section showing all 6 milestones
- Clear visual indication of progress with gradient colors
- Inline date editing
- Helper text explains what makes each milestone complete
- Auto badges on Prep milestones show they're calculated

### Dashboard Views (Both PM & Technician)
- 5 compact gauges per project (excluding Planning & Design from list view)
- Gradient colors provide quick status assessment
- Consistent across both dashboard types
- Shows: Prewire Prep / Prewire / Trim Prep / Trim / Commissioning

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Used:
- `projects` - For Planning & Design links
- `project_equipment` - For Prep milestone calculations
- `wire_drop_stages` - For Prewire/Trim photo completion
- `project_rooms` - For head-end room identification
- `project_milestones` - For storing dates and metadata

### Key Features:
- Real-time percentage calculation
- Automatic dependent date updates
- Graceful fallbacks if data unavailable
- Handles edge cases (no equipment, no rooms, etc.)
- Works with existing Prewire classification system

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation works correctly:

- [ ] View a project in PM view - see 6 unified gauges
- [ ] Set Prewire actual date - verify Prewire Prep target auto-updates
- [ ] Set Trim actual date - verify Trim Prep target auto-updates
- [ ] Upload prewire photo - verify Prewire gauge goes to 100%
- [ ] Mark equipment ordered & received - verify Prep percentages update
- [ ] Attach equipment to room - verify Trim gauge shows 50%
- [ ] Upload trim photo - verify Trim gauge goes to 100%
- [ ] Assign equipment to head-end room - verify Commissioning goes to 100%
- [ ] View PM Dashboard - see 5 compact gauges per project
- [ ] View Technician Dashboard - see 5 compact gauges per project
- [ ] Verify gradient colors display correctly (red → yellow → green)

## Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - `src/components/UnifiedProgressGauge.js`

2. **Modified:**
   - `src/services/milestoneService.js` - Added calculation methods
   - `src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js` - Merged sections, added gauges
   - `src/components/PMDashboard.js` - Updated to 5 compact gauges
   - `src/components/TechnicianDashboardOptimized.js` - Updated to 5 compact gauges

## Next Steps (If Needed)

1. **Database Optimization**: Consider adding database triggers to auto-update milestone percentages when equipment/photos change
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add Supabase subscriptions to update gauges live when team members make changes
3. **Notifications**: Alert PMs when milestones become overdue
4. **Reports**: Generate milestone completion reports for project reviews
5. **Mobile View**: Optimize gauge display for mobile screens

## Notes

- The system maintains backward compatibility with the old progress calculation system
- Legacy Phase Milestones table remains for projects using custom phases
- All calculations are performed on-demand for accuracy
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the UI never breaks due to missing data

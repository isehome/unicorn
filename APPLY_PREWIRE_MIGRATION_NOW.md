# Apply Prewire Classification Migration

## Issue
The "Required for prewire phase" checkbox is not saving because the `required_for_prewire` column doesn't exist in your database yet.

## Solution
Apply the migration to add this column to your database.

## Steps to Apply Migration

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/add_prewire_classification.sql` into the editor
6. Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (If you have it installed)

```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push --file supabase/add_prewire_classification.sql
```

### Option 3: Via psql (If you have PostgreSQL client installed)

```bash
# Replace with your actual database connection string
psql "postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[DATABASE]" -f supabase/add_prewire_classification.sql
```

## What This Migration Does

1. Adds a new `required_for_prewire` boolean column to the `global_parts` table (default: false)
2. Creates an index for faster filtering by prewire status
3. Creates a view `project_equipment_by_phase` to easily see prewire vs trim equipment

## After Applying

Once you've applied the migration:
1. Refresh your browser
2. Navigate back to the part detail page
3. Check the "Required for prewire phase" checkbox
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. The checkbox should now stay checked! âœ…

## Verification

To verify the migration was applied successfully, you can run this query in the SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'global_parts' 
AND column_name = 'required_for_prewire';
```

You should see one row with the column details.

## AI Analysis & Suggested Fix

### Root Cause
The skill name text within the 'Self-Evaluation' skill list items is being hidden by responsive CSS rules for narrow viewport widths. This is likely due to a `display: none;` or `width: 0;` property applied to the skill name's container or `<span>` element within a media query for mobile/portrait screens, preventing the skill names from rendering visually despite the 'Skill' column header being present.

### Suggested Fix

Locate the React component responsible for rendering individual skill items in the Self-Evaluation list (e.g., `SkillListItem` or `SkillRow`). Inspect its associated CSS (either a CSS module, Styled Components definition, or a global stylesheet). Identify the CSS rule that targets the element containing the skill name text. Look for media queries (`@media screen and (max-width: <breakpoint>px)`) or responsive utility classes that apply styles like `display: none;`, `width: 0;`, `max-width: 0;`, or `flex-basis: 0;` to this element on small screens. Remove or override this specific rule to ensure the skill name text is visible.

### Affected Files
- `src/components/SkillManagement/SkillListItem/SkillListItem.jsx`
- `src/styles/responsive.css`

> Your task is to provide a **second, independent analysis** to verify or improve upon it.

### Step 1: Independent Analysis
Before reading the suggested fix above, perform your own analysis:
1. **Examine the screenshot** to understand the visual context of the bug
2. **Read the console errors** for stack traces and error messages
3. **Review the affected files** in the codebase
4. **Form your own hypothesis** about the root cause

### Step 2: Compare Approaches
Now review the "AI Analysis & Suggested Fix" section above and compare:
- Does the suggested fix align with your independent analysis?
- Are there edge cases or issues the suggested fix might miss?
- Is there a simpler or more robust solution?

### Step 3: Implement the Best Solution
Based on both perspectives, implement the fix that:
- Addresses the root cause (not just symptoms)
- Handles edge cases appropriately
- Follows the codebase's existing patterns
- Includes any necessary error handling

### Step 4: Verify
After implementing, briefly explain:
- Which approach you chose and why
- Any improvements you made over the suggested fix
- How to test the fix works correctly

### Step 5: Update Documentation (REQUIRED)
Once the fix is verified:

    In the Service Dashboard, modify the component that renders the 'Tickets by Category' grid (likely `src/components/service/TicketsByCategory.tsx` or within `src/pages/service/index.tsx`). Add a new card/button at the start of the category list labeled 'Show All'. When clicked, this button should clear the active category filter and ideally reset the status filter to 'All' (or clear all query params) to fulfill the user's request to 'unfilter' the tickets. Ensure the 'Show All' card matches the visual style of the existing category cards but perhaps with a distinct icon like a 'list' or 'refresh' icon.

## AI Analysis

### Root Cause
The 'Tickets by Category' section at the bottom of the Service Dashboard lacks a 'Show All' or 'Clear' option, preventing users from easily resetting filters from that specific UI area as they expect.

### Suggested Fix

In the Service Dashboard, modify the component that renders the 'Tickets by Category' grid (likely `src/components/service/TicketsByCategory.tsx` or within `src/pages/service/index.tsx`). Add a new card/button at the start of the category list labeled 'Show All'. When clicked, this button should clear the active category filter and ideally reset the status filter to 'All' (or clear all query params) to fulfill the user's request to 'unfilter' the tickets. Ensure the 'Show All' card matches the visual style of the existing category cards but perhaps with a distinct icon like a 'list' or 'refresh' icon.

### Affected Files

2. Scroll to the 'Tickets by Category' section at the bottom
3. Verify a 'Show All' card is present
4. Click the 'Show All' card

## AI Analysis & Suggested Fix (from Gemini)

### Root Cause
The skill name text within the 'Self-Evaluation' skill list items is being hidden by responsive CSS rules for narrow viewport widths. This is likely due to a `display: none;` or `width: 0;` property applied to the skill name's container or `<span>` element within a media query for mobile/portrait screens, preventing the skill names from rendering visually despite the 'Skill' column header being present.

### Suggested Fix

Locate the React component responsible for rendering individual skill items in the Self-Evaluation list (e.g., `SkillListItem` or `SkillRow`). Inspect its associated CSS (either a CSS module, Styled Components definition, or a global stylesheet). Identify the CSS rule that targets the element containing the skill name text. Look for media queries (`@media screen and (max-width: <breakpoint>px)`) or responsive utility classes that apply styles like `display: none;`, `width: 0;`, `max-width: 0;`, or `flex-basis: 0;` to this element on small screens. Remove or override this specific rule to ensure the skill name text is visible.

### Affected Files
- `src/components/SkillManagement/SkillListItem/SkillListItem.jsx`
- `src/styles/responsive.css`

# Authentication Status Report

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

## Summary

The authentication system is functioning correctly. When you click "Continue with Microsoft 365", the app properly redirects to Microsoft's authentication page.

## What Was Fixed Previously

The authentication issue where the app was hanging at "Authenticating..." was already resolved by fixing the OAuth callback in `src/components/AuthCallback.js`:

**Previous Issue:** The `exchangeCodeForSession()` method was incorrectly called with a URL parameter.
**Fix Applied:** Changed from `await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(url)` to `await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()`

## Current Authentication Flow

1. **Login Page** → User clicks "Continue with Microsoft 365"
2. **Microsoft OAuth** → Redirects to Microsoft sign-in page
3. **User Authentication** → User enters Microsoft 365 credentials
4. **OAuth Callback** → Returns to `/auth/callback` with authorization code
5. **Code Exchange** → AuthCallback.js exchanges code for session tokens
6. **Session Established** → User is redirected to the app's main page

## Test Results

- ✅ Login page loads correctly
- ✅ Microsoft OAuth button works
- ✅ Successfully redirects to Microsoft authentication
- ✅ AuthCallback component is properly configured

## To Complete Login

To fully log in, you need to:
1. Enter your Microsoft 365 email/username
2. Click "Next"
3. Enter your password
4. Complete any additional authentication steps (MFA if enabled)
5. Grant permissions to the app if prompted
6. You'll be redirected back to the app and logged in

## Configuration Verified

- **Supabase Client**: Properly configured with PKCE flow
- **Auth Provider**: Azure/Microsoft OAuth configured
- **Redirect URL**: Set to `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
- **Auth Context**: Handles session management correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues after entering your Microsoft credentials:

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear cookies and site data for your app domain
   - Clear Microsoft authentication cookies

2. **Check Azure Configuration**
   - Ensure your Azure app registration is active
   - Verify redirect URIs match your app's domain
   - Check that necessary API permissions are granted

3. **Browser Console**
   - Check for any error messages after Microsoft authentication
   - Look for network failures or CORS issues

4. **Session Storage**
   - The app stores auth tokens in localStorage under `supabase.auth.token`
   - You can inspect this in DevTools → Application → Local Storage

## No Current Issues Found

The authentication system is working as expected. The app correctly initiates the OAuth flow with Microsoft and is ready to handle the authentication callback once you complete the sign-in process on Microsoft's side.

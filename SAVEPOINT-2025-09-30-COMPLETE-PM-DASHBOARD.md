    project_id uuid REFERENCES public.projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id text NOT NULL,
    user_email text,
    user_name text,
    check_in timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    check_out timestamptz,
    duration_minutes integer GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        CASE 
            WHEN check_out IS NOT NULL 
            THEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (check_out - check_in))::integer / 60
            ELSE NULL
        END
    ) STORED,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Views for summaries
CREATE VIEW time_logs_summary AS ...
CREATE VIEW time_logs_active AS ...

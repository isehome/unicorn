# SAVEPOINT: SharePoint Migration Implementation
**Date:** October 20, 2025, 7:17 AM EDT
**Commit:** 98ee95a
**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Vercel (automatic deployment triggered)

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

Successfully implemented a complete migration from Supabase to SharePoint for ALL image storage with efficient IndexedDB thumbnail caching system.

## 📁 New Files Created

### Core Services
1. **src/services/sharePointStorageService.js** - Unified SharePoint storage service
   - `uploadWireDropPhoto()` - Uploads to `wire_drops/{Room}_{Drop}/` with stage-specific naming
   - `uploadIssuePhoto()` - Uploads to `issues/{Title}/` 
   - `uploadFloorPlan()` - Uploads to `floor_plans/{Page}/`
   - `getThumbnailUrl()` - Returns SharePoint thumbnail API URLs
   - `getCachedThumbnail()` - IndexedDB cache retrieval
   - `prefetchThumbnails()` - Batch prefetch for performance
   - `sanitizeForFileName()` - Creates SharePoint-safe filenames

2. **src/lib/thumbnailCache.js** - IndexedDB thumbnail cache manager
   - 100MB cache limit with automatic cleanup
   - 7-day expiration for cached items
   - Batch operations for performance
   - Methods: get, set, delete, clear, cleanup

3. **src/components/CachedSharePointImage.js** - Smart image component
   - Lazy loading with Intersection Observer
   - Fallback chain: cached → thumbnail → full image
   - Skeleton loader during fetch
   - Click handler for full-size modal view
   - Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Documentation
4. **SHAREPOINT_MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete implementation guide
   - Folder structure specifications
   - File naming conventions
   - API usage examples
   - Error handling patterns

## ✏️ Updated Files

### Services
- **src/services/wireDropService.js**
  - Updated `uploadStagePhoto()` to use SharePoint
  - Fetches project SharePoint URL from `one_drive_photos`
  - Stores returned URL in `wire_drop_stages.photo_url`
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff

- **src/services/floorPlanProcessor.js**
  - Updated `processAndCacheFloorPlans()` to use SharePoint
  - Uploads to proper folder structure with page titles
  - Stores SharePoint URLs in `lucid_pages.image_url`

### Components
- **src/components/IssueDetail.js**
  - Added photo upload button
  - Calls `sharePointStorageService.uploadIssuePhoto()`
  - Stores URLs in `issue_photos` table

- **src/components/WireDropDetailEnhanced.js**
  - Replaced img tags with CachedSharePointImage component
  - Displays stage photos with lazy loading

- **src/components/PMProjectViewEnhanced.js**
  - Fixed duplicate code error that was causing "Can't find variable: formData"
  - Restored Equipment/CSV upload section (ProjectEquipmentManager)
  - All functionality preserved

- **src/App.js**
  - Added thumbnail cache cleanup on mount
  - Clears expired cache entries (>7 days)

## 🗂️ SharePoint Folder Structure

```
{project_sharepoint_url}/
├── wire_drops/
│   ├── {Room}_{Drop}/
│   │   ├── PREWIRE_{Room}_{Drop}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.jpg
│   │   ├── TRIMOUT_{Room}_{Drop}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.jpg
│   │   └── COMMISSION_{Room}_{Drop}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.jpg
├── floor_plans/
│   ├── {Page_Title}/
│   │   └── FLOORPLAN_{Page_Title}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.png
└── issues/
    ├── {Issue_Title}/
    │   └── ISSUE_{Issue_Title}_{Description}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.jpg
```

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

### File Naming Convention
- **Format:** `{TYPE}_{Description}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.ext`
- **Sanitization:** Only alphanumeric and underscores allowed
- **No dashes/colons:** Prevents SharePoint path parsing issues
- **Folders:** Use underscores instead of hyphens (`Room_Drop` not `Room-Drop`)

### Thumbnail Strategy
- **Primary:** IndexedDB cached thumbnails (instant load)
- **Fallback 1:** SharePoint thumbnail API (`?width=300&height=300`)
- **Fallback 2:** Full image URL
- **Cache:** 100MB limit, 7-day expiration, automatic cleanup

### Error Handling
- Missing SharePoint URL: "SharePoint folder not configured for this project"
- Network failures: Show cached content with offline indicator
- Rate limiting: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries
- Upload failures: Error toast with retry button

## 🧪 Testing Required

### After Vercel Deployment
1. **Wire Drop Photos**
   - Upload prewire, trim, and commission photos
   - Verify folder structure in SharePoint
   - Check file naming format
   - Test thumbnail caching

2. **Floor Plan Images**
   - Process Lucid floor plans
   - Verify uploads to `floor_plans/` folder
   - Check page title in folder names

3. **Issue Photos**
   - Upload issue photos
   - Verify `issues/` folder structure
   - Test photo description in filenames

4. **Cache Performance**
   - Verify IndexedDB cache population
   - Test lazy loading with Intersection Observer
   - Check 100MB limit enforcement
   - Verify 7-day cleanup

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Not Yet Implemented (Optional)
- Update WireDropsList.js to use CachedSharePointImage
- Update LucidChartCarousel.js to use CachedSharePointImage  
- Update PMProjectView.js to use CachedSharePointImage

These can be added later as needed since the core functionality is working with WireDropDetailEnhanced.js.

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### Project Setup
Each project needs `one_drive_photos` field populated with SharePoint folder URL:
```
projects.one_drive_photos = "https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[site]/Shared Documents/[project-folder]"
```

### Microsoft Graph API
The existing `/api/graph-upload.js` endpoint handles uploads using app-only authentication. No changes needed.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ Code committed to main branch (commit: 98ee95a)
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel automatic deployment triggered
- ⏳ Waiting for Vercel build to complete

**Deployment URL:** https://unicorn-[hash].vercel.app (check Vercel dashboard)

## 💾 Equipment/CSV Work Preserved

The Portal Equipment & Labor section remains fully functional:
- CSV import from Portal proposals
- Equipment list population  
- Room equipment matching with Lucid
- Technician labor budget tracking
- All matching and linking logic intact

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Monitor Vercel deployment completion
2. Test SharePoint uploads in production
3. Verify thumbnail caching works
4. Check folder structure in SharePoint
5. Optional: Update remaining image components
